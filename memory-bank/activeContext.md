## Active Decisions
1. Session Management:
   - Session considered valid if:
     - Has sessionId
     - Has questions
     - Has at least one answer
     - Current question index is valid
   - Clean up session on:
     - Starting new quiz
     - Explicit restart
   - Preserve session on:
     - Page reload/navigation
     - Quiz completion (for results view)

2. Keyboard Shortcuts:
   - Numbers 1-4 for MCQ options
   - Enter/Space to submit
   - Shift+Enter for new lines in FRQ
   - Enter/Space for next question after answering

3. UI/UX Patterns:
   - Gradient backgrounds for primary actions
   - Scale animations on hover/active states
   - Consistent button heights (h-14 for primary, h-12 for secondary)
   - Blue accent color for action buttons
   - Animated transitions for state changes
   - Clear visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers

4. Quiz Flow:
   - Must configure quiz before starting first time
   - Can return to config after starting via settings
   - Progressive disclosure of keyboard shortcuts
   - Session recovery on return to quiz
   - Explanation state preserved between sessions

## Current Learnings
1. User Experience:
   - First-time users need guidance on keyboard shortcuts
   - FRQ answers benefit from multiline support
   - Visual feedback important for answer states
   - Session persistence crucial for longer quizzes

2. Technical:
   - Textarea vs Input considerations for FRQ
   - Keyboard event handling complexity
   - State management for quiz progress
   - Importance of proper session cleanup
   - Need for comprehensive state persistence

## Next Steps
1. Potential Enhancements:
   - Timer functionality implementation
   - More keyboard shortcuts
   - Additional question types
   - Enhanced progress tracking
   - Session timeout handling
   - Auto-save functionality

2. Improvements:
   - Mobile responsiveness review
   - Accessibility audit
   - Performance optimization
   - Session recovery edge cases
   - Error handling improvements

## Project Insights
1. UI Components:
   - Shadcn components require careful styling to maintain theme consistency
   - Modal positioning benefits from fixed + inset approach over default dialog positioning
   - Select components need specific handling for dark theme

2. Quiz Logic:
   - Question formatting needs to handle both MCQ and FRQ content types
   - Session recovery requires careful state management
   - Type safety is crucial for quiz state management
   - State persistence needs to balance completeness with performance

## Known Issues
1. Modal positioning requires specific styling to maintain proper centering
2. Select components may need additional dark theme adjustments
3. Quiz session recovery needs robust error handling
4. Need to handle network errors during session persistence
