# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Refining the achievement progress bar UI component
- Improving visual representation of achievement milestones
- Ensuring proper z-index layering for visual components
- Enhancing user experience through clear progress visualization
- Maintaining accessibility and tooltip functionality
- Fixing UI rendering issues with achievement icons and progress indicators

## Recent Changes
- Fixed achievement progress bar layout and styling
- Adjusted z-index values to ensure icons are visible on top of gray marker lines
- Added proper TypeScript ESLint rule to handle any types where necessary
- Improved visual hierarchy with proper layering:
  - Gray marker lines (z-index: 5)
  - Progress bar (implied z-index: 10)
  - Current position indicator (z-index: 15)
  - Achievement icons (z-index: 20)
- Ensured achievement icons are properly positioned at their respective thresholds
- Fixed icon positioning with precise CSS styling and transforms

## Key Decisions
1. Visual Hierarchy:
   - Achievement icons should appear on top of the gray marker lines
   - Current position indicator should be prominently visible
   - Z-index values carefully managed to create proper layering

2. Component Architecture:
   - Maintained clean separation of progress bar, markers, and icons
   - Used relative positioning for precise alignment
   - Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces for achievement requirements
   - Added ESLint comments where necessary to handle JsonValue compatibility

3. State Management:
   - Used props for achievements and current points
   - Calculated progress percentage based on max threshold
   - Properly determined unlocked achievements based on current points

## Next Steps
- Consider adding subtle animation for achievement unlocking
- Implement notification system for newly unlocked achievements
- Explore better mobile responsiveness for the progress bar
- Consider implementing smooth progress transitions
- Add enhanced accessibility features for screen readers

## Active Patterns
- Visual Layering: Using z-index for proper component stacking
- Responsive Design: Full-width progress bar with relative positioning
- Tooltips: Providing detailed achievement information on hover
- Conditional Styling: Different visual treatment for locked/unlocked achievements
- Error Handling: Ensuring proper display even with missing image data

## Recent Learnings
- Proper z-index management for overlapping elements
- Precise positioning with transform and CSS calculations
- TypeScript ESLint rule management for edge cases
- Visual hierarchy best practices for progress indicators
- Image component error handling techniques

## Additional Notes
- Achievement badges are rendered as Image components with proper alt text
- The progress bar visually indicates current progress toward maximum threshold
- Tooltips provide additional context about each achievement
- The component handles both locked and unlocked achievement states with different styling
- ESLint rules have been properly managed with specific comments where needed
