# Active Context

## Current Focus

The application is focused on providing a streamlined learning experience with an emphasis on progress tracking and achievement visualization. Recent changes include:

- Combined Study Progress and Achievements into a single tabbed interface for better UX
- Tabs include:
  1. Study Progress - Shows learning metrics, activity, and stats
  2. Achievements - Displays global achievements

## Recent Changes

- Merged separate Study Progress and Achievements sections into a unified "Learning Progress" card
- Implemented tabbed navigation using shadcn/ui Tabs components
- Maintained all existing functionality while making the UI more compact
- Progress tab includes:
  - Cards reviewed progress
  - Mastery level tracking
  - Weekly activity visualization
  - Key stats (Minutes studied, Streak, Total points)

## Active Decisions

- Using a 2-column tab layout for clear section separation
- Maintaining motion animations for progress bars and activity charts
- Keeping the card styling consistent with the rest of the application
- Using descriptive tab labels for clear navigation

## Project Insights

- Combining related features into tabbed interfaces helps reduce vertical scrolling
- Motion animations enhance the user experience when displaying progress
- Weekly activity visualization provides valuable insights into study patterns
- The unified card design maintains visual hierarchy while improving space efficiency

## Next Steps

- Consider adding tab persistence across sessions
- Evaluate the need for additional progress metrics
- Monitor user interaction with the tabbed interface for potential improvements
- Consider adding loading states for tab content

## Important Patterns
- Using Clerk for user authentication
- Achievement categories: study, mastery, streak, points
- Achievement data structure includes requirements and progress tracking
- Using Prisma for database interactions

## Recent Learnings
- Achievement system structure and categories
- Progress tracking requirements for different achievement types
- Integration points between user actions and achievement unlocking

## Current Focus
- Achievement system implementation
- Points system integration
- Database schema for achievements
- API endpoints for achievement tracking
- UI/UX for achievement notifications

## Recent Changes
1. Achievement System Development
   - Created achievement badge SVGs with modern design
   - Implemented achievement notification component
   - Added achievement check in QuizResults
   - Designed points system for quizzes and flashcards

2. Achievement Badge Design
   - Modern, abstract achievement template
   - Neural/learning theme
   - Unique icons for each achievement type
   - Consistent style with gradients and animations
   - Created badges for all achievement types

3. Points System Design
   - Quiz points based on accuracy
   - Flashcard points based on SRS difficulty
   - Session tracking for streaks
   - Points persistence in user profile

## Active Decisions

   - Progress visualization
   - Badge design impact

2. Technical:
   - SVG animation techniques
   - Achievement tracking logic
   - Points calculation methods
   - Database schema design

## Project Insights
1. Achievement System:
   - Motivates user engagement
   - Provides clear progress metrics
   - Enhances learning experience
   - Gamification benefits

2. Technical Architecture:
   - Separate achievement logic
   - Reusable notification system
   - Efficient points tracking
   - Scalable achievement types

## Known Issues
1. Need to implement database tables
2. API endpoints not created yet
3. Points system needs integration
4. Achievement checks needed in flashcards
