## Project Insights

- Session management requires proper cleanup of both session IDs and timestamps to ensure accurate time tracking
- Using upsert operations for database records that have unique constraints helps prevent errors and improve robustness
- When handling quiz stats, grouping by metric type (accuracy, completion) helps create a clearer user experience
- Combining related features into tabbed interfaces helps reduce vertical scrolling
- Motion animations enhance the user experience when displaying progress
- Weekly activity visualization provides valuable insights into study patterns
- The unified card design maintains visual hierarchy while improving space efficiency
- For real-time updates during long-running processes:
  - Regular polling with clear state management is crucial for a smooth UX
  - It's important to handle intermediate states without reinitializing the entire session
  - Providing visual feedback on progress (rainbow spinner, progress bar, stage messages) maintains user engagement
  - Always validate and handle API response data with defaults to prevent UI errors
- For complex data visualization:
  - Hierarchical layout algorithms provide better organization of related concepts
  - Analyzing connection patterns helps identify important nodes
  - Custom UI elements (like scrollbars) should maintain design consistency
  - Multi-stage processing of layout produces better results than single-pass algorithms

## Next Steps

## Important Patterns
- Session management pattern:
  ```typescript
  // When ending a session, clear both sessionId and sessionStartTime
  endSession: async () => {
    // ...
    set({ 
      // ...
      sessionStartTime: null,
      sessionId: null // Clear the session ID to prevent reuse
    });
    // ...
  }
  
  // When starting a session, check for existing sessionId and handle properly
  startSession: async () => {
    const { deckId, sessionId, sessionStartTime } = get();
    
    // If there's an existing session, end it properly first
    if (sessionId) {
      await get().endSession();
    }
    
    // Continue with new session creation
    // ...
  }
  ```
- Achievement database upsert pattern:
  ```typescript
  // Use upsert to handle potential duplicate achievements
  for (const achievement of achievementsToCreate) {
    try {
      await db.userAchievement.upsert({
        where: {
          userId_achievementId: {
            userId: userId,
            achievementId: achievement.id
          }
        },
        update: {}, // No updates if exists
        create: {
          userId: userId,
          achievementId: achievement.id,
          unlockedAt: new Date()
        }
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error creating achievement ${achievement.id}:`, error);
      // Continue with other achievements
    }
  }
  ```
- Using Clerk for user authentication
- Achievement categories: study, mastery, streak, points
- Achievement data structure includes requirements and progress tracking
- Using Prisma for database interactions
- Progress tracking pattern for processing:
  ```typescript
  {
    isProcessing: boolean;
    processingProgress: number;
    processingStage: 'CHUNKING' | 'GENERATING' | 'MINDMAP' | 'COMPLETED' | 'ERROR';
    processedChunks: number;
    totalChunks: number;
    error?: string;
    mindMap?: {
      nodes: Array<{ id: string; label: string; type: 'main' | 'subtopic' | 'detail' }>;
      connections: Array<{ source: string; target: string; label: string; type: string }>;
    };
  }
  ```
- Advanced mind map layout algorithm pattern:
  ```typescript
  // 1. Analyze the graph structure
  const nodeConnectionCount = originalNodes.reduce((acc, node) => {
    acc[node.id] = connections.filter(c => c.source === node.id || c.target === node.id).length;
    return acc;
  }, {} as Record<string, number>);
  
  // 2. Identify central/important nodes based on connection count
  const centralNodes = [...originalNodes].sort((a, b) => 
    (nodeConnectionCount[b.id] || 0) - (nodeConnectionCount[a.id] || 0)
  ).slice(0, 3).map(n => n.id);
  
  // 3. Process nodes in stages - main nodes first
  const mainNodesWithPositions = mainNodes.map((node, index) => {
    // Position calculation for main nodes
  });

  // 4. Process subtopic nodes using positions from main nodes
  const subtopicNodesWithPositions = subtopicNodes.map((node) => {
    // Position relative to connected main nodes
  });

  // 5. Process detail nodes using positions from main and subtopic nodes
  const detailNodesWithPositions = detailNodes.map((node) => {
    // Position relative to connected nodes
  });

  // 6. Combine all nodes
  const nodes = [...mainNodesWithPositions, ...subtopicNodesWithPositions, ...detailNodesWithPositions];
  ```
- Custom scrollbar styling pattern:
  ```css
  .custom-scrollbar {
    scrollbar-width: thin;
    scrollbar-color: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.5) rgba(24, 24, 27, 0.5);
  }

  .custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 8px;
    height: 8px;
  }

  .custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
    background: rgba(24, 24, 27, 0.5);
    border-radius: 4px;
  }

  .custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.5);
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
  ```
