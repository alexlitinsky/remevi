# Progress

## What Works

### Core Features
- User authentication and session management
- Document upload and processing
- Flashcard generation and study sessions
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Achievement system
- Combined progress and achievements display in tabbed interface

### UI Components
- Responsive layout with motion animations

- Study deck cards with progress indicators

## Current Status

The application has a streamlined UI that effectively combines related features:
- Study progress and achievements are now displayed in a single card with tabs
- Progress tracking includes comprehensive metrics and visualizations
- Achievement system is fully integrated into the main interface
- Weekly activity tracking provides clear study pattern insights

## Known Issues
- Tab content might need loading states
- Consider persistence for tab selection
- May need additional progress metrics

## Evolution of Decisions

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Initially had separate cards for progress and achievements
2. Combined into single card with tabs for better space efficiency
3. Maintained all functionality while reducing vertical scrolling
4. Enhanced user experience with motion animations

### Progress Tracking
1. Basic progress indicators
2. Added detailed weekly activity visualization
